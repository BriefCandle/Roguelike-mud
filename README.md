# netherscape - Pokemon Demo

This only serves as demo, so, unfortunately, the coding pattern is not maintained properly. And it might never will if it migrates straight to mud v2 or create a new (better) game. Besides, pokemonball and some other battle-related mechanisms (smart contract wise) are either not completed or not tested thoroughly.

Other than that, the code is cool with the following highlighted features:
- Parcel/map creation & dungeon declaration on the fly
- Pokemon class and moves creation on the fly
- Interaction with object on a map.
- Commit-and-reveal RNG 
- Turn-based PvP & PvE
- Offer-accpetance PvP
- Nostalgic GBA appearance with MMO enabled


First,  
```$yarn install```

Second,  
```$yarn dev```

Third, cd to contracts, and run some sample scripts 
```$bash pokemonScript.sh```

Let me know if you think it is a fun project, and it would like to make it more interesting~
