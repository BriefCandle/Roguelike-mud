# roguelike-mud
This is my attempt to generalize rpg (role-playing game) under MUD's ECS (entity-component-system) pattern. Specifically speaking, I am trying to setup a generalized framework that should work across different types of rpgs. To showcase the concept, I am making a roguelike (i.e., dungeon-crawling) game as an MVP. However, more gameplay elements (characters and equipment), artworks, mechanisms, or even whole different rpg gamesets (for example, SD Gundam, Pokemon) can be added to the "world", which should open up for all different players and allow them to apply different tokenomics and to host their own rpg games. That could be the kind of "MetaVerse" that the MUD team never talk about. Anyway, I hope MUD's ECS model can afford us the exact amount of generalization and specification to build future on-chain games.
